What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	- When I initialize a repository, I create a hidden .git folder that sets
	up configuration details. I need to initialize in order to create this
	folder. If I didn't initialize, git wouldn't know what folder should be
	part of the repository I want to create.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	- The working directory contains actual local files. The repository 
	contains committed files. The staging area lets you toy around with adding
	local files to a package that will later be added to the repository. Without
	a staging area, we could only commit one file at a time, unless there was
	some other command that allowed for committing multiple files at once. In
	any case, the staging area is nice because it allows the user to add and
	remove files from being part of a commit before "committing" (no pun
	intended) to actually adding them.
