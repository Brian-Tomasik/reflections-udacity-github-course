What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	- When I initialize a repository, I create a hidden .git folder that sets
	up configuration details. I need to initialize in order to create this
	folder. If I didn't initialize, git wouldn't know what folder should be
	part of the repository I want to create.
