When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  - When collaborating with others
  - As a way to back up in case the local hard drive crashes
  - To share your work publicly

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	The remote might have changes that are inconsistent with your local version.
